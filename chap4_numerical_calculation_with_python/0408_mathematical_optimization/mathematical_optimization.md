## Mathematical Optimization
A problem that maximizes(or minimize) the value of 
a function in given constraints 
is called as <b>mathematical optimization problem<b>.

## component
Mathematical optimization problems consists of two components, 
<b>an objective function<b> (called variously 
<b>a loss function<b> or <b>a cost function<b>) 
and <b>constraints<b>.

* mathematical optimization problems
    * an objective function
    * constraints

A feasible solution that maximizes(or minimizes) 
the objective function is called an <b>optimal solution<b> 
and the objective function value of that time is called an <b>optimal value<b>.

## elementally typical problems
* linear programming
* non-linear programming

## computational optimization techniques
To solve problems, researchers may use algorithms 
called <b>iterative methods<b> that converge to a solution.

## iterative methods
* Methods that evaluate Hessian(or approximate Hessian)
   * Newton's method (IN THIS REPOSITORY)
       Calculate solutions of a given equation numerically. 
   * (sequential) quadratic programming (IN THIS REPOSITORY)
   
* Methods that evaluate gradients(or approximate gradients)
   * gradient descent (IN THIS REPOSITORY)
